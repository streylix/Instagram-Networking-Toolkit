## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer and Important Warnings

### Account Safety
**CRITICAL NOTICE:** Using automated tools like this can significantly risk your Instagram account:

- **High Risk of Account Restrictions:** Instagram actively monitors and can permanently ban or shadowban accounts using automation tools.
- **Personal Warning:** From my experience, attempting to use longer delays or more complex timing mechanisms does NOT reduce the risk. In fact, it may increase the likelihood of your account being flagged. I used this on/off for about a week and never got truly flagged until I started stretching my delay-times. I believe the method is to have it function as humanly as possible, which is how it's configured at the moment. Use with caution

### Potential Consequences
- Temporary action blocks
- Permanent account suspension
- Removal of follow/unfollow privileges
- Reduced account visibility

### Best Practices
- Use this tool sparingly, if at all
- Never run mass actions on your primary account
- Be prepared for potential account restrictions
- Consider the risks before each action

**ABSOLUTE CAUTION:** Instagram's terms of service explicitly prohibit the use of unauthorized automation tools. Use of this script is entirely at your own risk.

## üîß Troubleshooting
- Ensure you have the latest version of `instagrapi`
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Instagram credentials
- Respect Instagram's rate limits
