some updates I want to add to these files

in the manager, I want to be able to modify a config file that lets me modify aspects of the other scripts without having to restart the application

in discover, I want there to be logic that if the number of selected users reaches the limit while getting users from a following list, then it halts the program such that it never exceeds the maximum desired user count

Instead of having the discovery output to multiple files, it should just continue updating a singular json file.

the json files from the finder should be named appropriately (i.e, if it's a users followers it should be "_followers" and if it is following "_following")

In the config file there should be the ability to modify the delay time between each follow in the follower script

There should be functionality in the manager for deleting a user from the discover json. it should prompt the user for a name (in a loop incase of typos) and if it finds a valid name, delete every attribute in "followers" with a parent attribute equal to that name

add a rule in both discovery and finder where you don't add yourself to the json

add a rule in instagram_follow such that you don't attempt to follow yourself
